# AKARI Video Documentation

**Hand over your footage and it comes back edited. Open it, review it, fix only what matters.**

|---|---|
| [Introduction](./introduction.md) | What AKARI Video is — three principles, architecture at a glance, workflow |
| [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) | Three entrances, creating your first project, the intake form |

## Guides

Task-based guides, ordered by the flow of production.

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| [Plan from scratch](./guides/plan-from-scratch.md) | Ideas → research → brief → storyboard → shot list (research-plan) |
| [Analyze footage](./guides/analyze-footage.md) | Proxies, transcription, keyframe extraction, and cross-clip analysis (analyze-footage / analyze-project) |
| [Plan your edit](./guides/plan-your-edit.md) | Three approval steps into edit.json (edit-plan) |

## Skills

The workflow ships as 22 agent-side skills. The [Skills Catalog](./skills.md) is the
single map: what each skill owns, when it triggers, and which external tools and
animation runtimes it connects to — including the two 3D paths.

| [FAQ & troubleshooting](./how-to/faq.md) | Common questions and error handling |

## Reference

Data contracts (schemas) and design documents. **This repository is the canonical source.**
All contracts follow the
[three versioning principles](./contract-2026-07-17-data-contract-versioning.md)
(mandatory version field, additive-only evolution, explicit migration).

> [!NOTE]
> Reference documents are currently Japanese-only. Open an issue if you need a
> specific contract in English.
